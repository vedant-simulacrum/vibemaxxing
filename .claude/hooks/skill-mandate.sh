# that reached cnt>=2 stopped producing rows, and only short-lived fixtures (which never latch)

# Per-mandate latch (coordinator-directed, replacing the two SHARED family counters above).
# f4f5468 already proved a shared counter bleeds across unrelated mandates -- measured, not
# theorized: skill-mandate's original single $cnt hit 2 within a session's first two evaluated
# Stops and silenced the UNRELATED delegation breadth mandate for the remaining 7 Stops of a real
# 64-minute, 90-dispatch, 36-directory session, latched:true with every count null the whole way.
# That commit split skill-vs-delegation into two counters. It did not split further: within the
# skill family, unslop/typescript-best-practices/prove-it-works still shared ONE counter, so two
# unrelated unslop misses disarmed typescript-best-practices and prove-it-works for the rest of
# the session even though neither had ever been tried, let alone failed -- the identical bleed,
# one level down. Same shape inside the delegation family once swarm became a third sibling of
# breadth/agent-naming on $dcnt: two naming strikes would have silenced the swarm mandate this
# release exists to add. Every mandate below now gets its own counter file and its own 2-strike
# cap, so tripping one never silences another.
#
# The cap itself is UNCHANGED at 2, and the reason is unchanged too: a mandate the model
# genuinely cannot satisfy (the Skill tool itself broken, or a skill file missing/corrupt) must
# not trap the session in an unbounded block-retry loop -- proven by simulation in 4693558 (the
# verify-gate latch this file's design was copied from): 5 Stops against an always-failing check
# produced exactly 3 blocks then silence once the counter was made to persist instead of reset.
# VSTACK_NO_MANDATE=1 is printed in every block reason as the escape hatch, but it needs an
# operator to act on it -- env vars set inside one Bash tool_use do not persist to the next
# Bash call in Claude Code's execution model, so the model cannot reliably self-administer it
# mid-session. The 2-strike cap is what actually bounds the wedge when nobody is there to read
# the escape-hatch line. Splitting the counter narrows WHICH mandate goes quiet after 2 misses;
# it does not touch whether it does, or when.
#
# Filenames: still "$cnt_file" (== "vstack-mandate-$sid") as the base, one distinct suffix per
# mandate on top of it, same convention the original $cnt_file.delegate split already used -- so
# anything that already sweeps "$cnt_file*" (tests/test-breadth-mandate.sh's sweep_latch_, and
# check 27's own cleanup glob "vstack-mandate-*vfy-[a-q]*", which is anchored loosely enough on
# both ends to already cover any suffix appended after the session id) keeps sweeping every one
# of these without needing to know the new names:
#   skill family (session-persistent, no window):
#     $cnt_file.unslop  $cnt_file.typescript  $cnt_file.proveitworks
#   delegation family (windowed, cnt+timestamp pair per mandate):
#     $cnt_file.delegate-breadth(-ts)  $cnt_file.delegate-naming(-ts)  $cnt_file.delegate-swarm(-ts)
# $cnt_file.delegate-scan (the re-scan cooldown) and $cnt_file.lock stay singular and family-wide
# -- neither one is a strike counter, both exist purely to bound how often the expensive
# transcript scan itself runs, which is a family-wide cost regardless of which member mandate
# would have paid for it.
# Bash `read` builtin, not `cat`: reading a counter file this way costs zero process forks --
# `read -r v < "$file"` opens and consumes the file entirely inside the current shell, where
# `v=$(cat "$file")` pays for both a subshell (to capture the command substitution) AND a
# separate `cat` exec. That difference is the whole reason this is written this way instead of
# the more obvious cat-based one-liner: nine of these run every Stop now (six mandates, three of
# them windowed with a paired timestamp file), where the shared-counter design before this only
# ever paid for three. Measured, not assumed: the first cat-based draft of this block landed
# skill-mandate.sh's own fork-cost mean at 24.15u against tests/hook-latency.sh's 24.6u budget --
# technically under, but close enough that a noisier run could tip it red for a reason that has
# nothing to do with what the hook actually decided. `read`'s own error message on a missing
# input file would otherwise leak to stderr; `2>/dev/null` must sit BEFORE the `<` redirection on
# the same simple command, because redirections attach left to right and the failure happens
# while opening `<` itself, before a later `2>/dev/null` would take effect.

#   39.1MB / larger session      : mean 2009ms, p50 2002ms, p95 2114ms, max 2114ms  (n=10)
# roughly 12-17x the synthetic estimate, because the mandates below don't read the transcript
# once -- $paths, $skills, $bash_cmds, task_count, and turn_json are each their own jq/awk pass
# over the whole file. At k=10 the amortized mean (~144-200ms) would still look tolerable next to
# the ~16ms this fix already accepted for the null-count row, but a Stop hook runs synchronously
# in the one moment a long session is trying to end, and the number that matters there is the
# tail, not the mean: 1 latched Stop in 10 would synchronously stall that exact moment by 1.4-2.1s,
# on exactly the sessions this file exists not to trap. That is a user-visible regression traded
# for data on an instrument (tests/delegation-drift.sh) whose own live run the same day measured
# needing >=8 eligible windows per tertile against 2-3 available -- more rows at this per-row cost
# would not have closed that gap by the next release either.
#
# Revisit only with new evidence, not new arithmetic: a measured (not estimated) full-evaluation

# Write/Edit/NotebookEdit tool_use blocks are not the only way a session changes a file. In
# bypass-permissions mode the model is explicitly told to prefer Bash -- sed, heredocs, short
# scripts -- over the dedicated Edit/Write tools, and every one of those edits was invisible to
# every mandate above: a v1.35.0 release cut six files across five directories and three
# extensions entirely through `sed -i` and `python3 - <<PY` heredocs, and the breadth mandate
# never fired. This scans every Bash tool_use block's .input.command for a bounded set of write
# patterns and folds anything it recognizes into $paths below it, so the breadth mandate (and,
# as a side effect, the prose/TypeScript ones, which key off the same $paths) see Bash-mediated
# edits the same way they see Edit/Write ones.
#
# Recognized, in order: `sed -i` / `sed -i.bak` (the last whitespace-separated argument is taken
# as the target file); `>` / `>>` / `&>` output redirection and `tee [-a]` (this also covers
# `cat > path <<EOF`-style heredoc writers, since it is the redirect that is matched, not the
# heredoc body); `cp` / `mv` (the last non-flag argument is taken as the destination); and Python
# `open(PATH, 'w'...)` / `'a'...` / `'x'...` calls with a literal string path, anywhere in the
# command text -- which is what a `python3 - <<'PY' ... PY` heredoc writer looks like once jq has
# flattened it to one string.
#
# Residual blind spots, left uncaught on purpose rather than chased with more regex:
#   - a quoted path containing a space truncates at the first space (`> "a b.txt"` yields `a`)
#   - a `sed -i` / `cp` / `mv` / `tee` invocation naming more than one target file only yields
#     the last one (`sed -i '' -e s/a/b/ x.sh y.sh` sees only y.sh)
#   - commands invoked by full path (`/bin/cp`, `/usr/bin/sed -i`), via `sudo`, `xargs`, `eval`,
#     `find -exec`, or with a `VAR=val cmd` prefix are not recognized as the command at all
#   - a Python write via a variable, an f-string, `pathlib.Path(...).write_text(...)`, or any
#     open() call whose path is not a literal string is invisible
#   - `touch`, `mkdir`, `install`, `rsync`, `dd`, and redirection to a process substitution or an
#     fd number are not treated as writes
#   - a literal `>` inside a quoted string earlier on the same line (`echo "a > b" > out`) can be
#     misread as its own redirect target -- this is the price of not tokenizing the shell, and it
#     is a false *addition* to $paths, not a false mandate-met: it can only make the breadth
#     mandate name a Bash line it otherwise would not have, never suppress one that is real
#   - the same trap in the mirror: `[[ "$x" > "$y" ]]` and `[ "$a" > "$b" ]` are lexicographic
#     string comparisons, not redirects, and the redirect scan cannot tell the difference -- it
#     reads `$y`/`$b` off as a write target. This used to be dismissed here as inert noise on the
#     theory that a bare `$var` has neither `/` nor `.` to supply a second directory or extension
#     on its own. That theory was wrong, measured against a real 15MB transcript: combined with
#     heredoc-body leakage (below), unexpanded-`$` candidates were not inert, they were the
#     dominant term behind a reported 53 directories / 83 extensions for a session that had
#     written one real file. `emit()` now drops any candidate containing `$` outright rather
#     than trusting it to stay harmless -- cheap, and it removes this whole family in one place
#     regardless of which rule produced the candidate.
#   - a line inside an open heredoc body is skipped entirely (tracked by the in_hd/hd_delim state
#     machine in emit()'s caller), so `cat > new-check.sh <<'EOF'` counts only new-check.sh, not
#     every `>`/`cp`/`mv`/`open()`-shaped line the generated script's own body happens to contain.
#     Before this, a test-fixture generator that wrote fixture code containing its own example
#     `printf ... > path` was read as this session performing that write too -- the other half of
#     the 53/83 measurement above. Residual within this fix: two heredocs opened on the same
#     physical line, or a delimiter line that also carries trailing content after it, are not
#     modeled -- both are rare enough in practice that chasing them was not worth it here.
#   - a same-line `>` used as a comparison/arithmetic/format-string character *outside* a heredoc
#     body -- `awk '{if (a>b) ...}'`, a `printf` format token like `%.3f` that happens to follow a
#     stray `>` earlier on the line -- is still misread as a redirect target exactly as before.
#     Suppressing heredoc bodies removed most of this family's real-world volume (it is what most
#     of these lines were embedded in), and the survivors are short, extension-poor, non-slash
#     tokens (`9.9`, `1{print`, `>>>>>`) that read the same way the existing extension-less-token

    # to disk, not a command running in this turn. Before this fix the same `>>?` / `cp`/`mv`
    # regexes ran over body lines too, so a generated test fixture that itself contained
    # `printf ... > "$g_empty/app/src/C.tsx"` or `mv .github/workflows/verify.yml /tmp/...`
    # inside its own body text was read as a second, third, fourth real write by *this*
    # session -- confirmed against a real 15MB transcript, where it was the dominant term
    # behind a reported 53 directories / 83 extensions that should have been ~1. The state
    # machine below tracks whether the current physical line is inside an open heredoc body
    # (in_hd) and skips all extraction there, resuming only once a line equal to the opening
    # delimiter (optionally indented, for `<<-`) is seen. It does not attempt to track nested
    # heredocs inside a body -- while in_hd, every line is skipped outright, including one that
    # looks like it opens another heredoc, which is correct: it is body text either way, and the
    # only delimiter that matters is the outer one already being waited for.
    #
    # A here-string (`cmd <<<"$x"`) does not falsely open heredoc-suppression: after consuming
    # `<<` plus an optional `-` plus optional spaces, the next character is still the third `<`,
    # which matches neither the stripped-quote branch nor a bareword delimiter, so the match
    # fails and in_hd is never set. A bitshift (`$((1 << 3))`) fails the same way -- the char
    # after `<<` is a digit, not `[A-Za-z_]`. Checked by hand against both shapes before shipping.
    #
    # Suppression only engages when the SAME physical line also matched one of the write rules
    # above (line_had_write) -- this is not incidental, it is the line separating an inert
    # heredoc from an executed one. `cat > file <<EOF` and `tee file <<EOF` both write the body
    # to a file verbatim; the body never runs, so any `>`/`cp`/`open()`-shaped text inside it
    # describes what the generated file contains, not what this Bash call did. `python3 - <<PY`
    # and `bash <<EOF`, by contrast, pipe the body to an interpreter that executes it immediately
    # in this same tool call -- neither line matches any write rule on its own (no redirect, no
    # cp/mv, nothing), so line_had_write is 0 and the body is scanned normally, meaning
    # `open("config/c.json", "w")` inside that body is still counted, correctly, as a real write.
    # Gating on line_had_write rather than on the presence of `<<` alone is what tells these two
    # shapes apart without knowing what command is on the line -- the first version of this fix
    # suppressed both alike and silently broke the one fixture (test-breadth-mandate.sh PROOF 5)
    # that depends on a `python3 - <<PY` heredoc's write being seen.

# Multi-directory, multi-type work without delegation. Detects work that spans parts by

# present to trigger, avoiding false blocks on mechanical repetition.
#
# Why not count files? Because 5 test fixtures (fixtures/case1.json through case5.json) is
# 1 directory and 1 extension — mechanical repetition, not multi-part work. But a real change
# (hook.sh, test/hook.test.sh, doc/HOOK.md, manifest.json) spans 4 directories and 3 types —
# that is work with parts, and is what subagents exist for.
#
# Edge cases that stay silent by design:
# - 6 .md files across 6 directories: 6 dirs, 1 extension → no block (single type is focused).
# - 10 .js files in src/: 1 directory, 1 extension → no block (single directory is cohesive).
# - 3 dotfiles (.editorconfig, .gitignore, .npmrc) across 3 dirs: 3 dirs, 0 extensions → no block.
#

# (it is pure name, not name + type). .eslintrc.json yields json; .eslintrc yields nothing.

# Dispatch-tool name: the subagent-launch tool is called "Task" in the classic Claude Code CLI

# every session running that build: the former claimed "zero subagents" over 70 of them, the
# latter (gated on task_count>=1) was structurally unable to ever fire. Counting both names is
# not future-proofed against a third rename; a build using neither counts 0 and this hook falls
# back to its existing bias (say nothing rather than guess) rather than accusing a session that
# genuinely delegated under a name this file does not yet know.
#
# "TaskCreate" is deliberately NOT included here. It exists in this same build and looked like a

# from "three subagents in one batch", and the breadth mandate below used to gate on task_count
# alone -- satisfied by a single Task call, exactly the failure mode this splits out.
#
# What actually runs concurrently in Claude Code is every tool_use block inside ONE assistant
# message: the harness executes them together and returns their results in the next user turn,
# not one Task at a time. So the unit that matters is "how many Task/Agent blocks shares one
# message", not "how many exist in the transcript". Two ways that unit shows up on disk, both
# handled here:
#   - a fixture (and some transcript writers) puts a whole message's content array on ONE JSONL
#     line -- N tool_use blocks in that one line's .message.content are unambiguously one batch.
#   - a real streaming Claude Code CLI transcript splits one message's content blocks across
#     MULTIPLE, immediately consecutive JSONL lines that all share the same .message.id --
#     confirmed against this machine's own 5b14be87 session (see the "dogfooded" comment above):
#     msg_011CeHz4AqmXQiL4T85zgdpg's content (thinking, text, 3x tool_use) landed as 5 back-to-
#     back lines, not one.
# Grouping is done by CONSECUTIVE-run, not by a global "group by message.id": the same session
# has 8 message.id values that reappear thousands of lines apart after a compaction/resume,
# each reappearance surrounded by entirely different assistant lines in between -- a global
# group-by would silently merge two unrelated real turns' dispatches into one inflated batch.
# uniq-style consecutive grouping (a run ends the moment the id changes, even if that same id
# value shows up again later) keeps those two turns separate, which matched this file's own
# adjacency check line for line. A null/missing .message.id (every fixture in this suite, and
# any transcript writer that never sets one) is never merged with a neighbor even if adjacent --
# there is no identity to merge on, so each such line is its own singleton batch. That is what
# makes "two Task calls in two separate lines, neither carrying an id" read as two batches of

# --- delegation-drift logger (tests/delegation-drift.sh) ---------------------------------------
# Every field below -- dir_count, ext_count, task_count, named -- is already sitting in a
# variable by this point in the script; the breadth and agent-naming mandates above computed all
# of it to decide whether to block. This appends one line recording it, which costs one jq
# invocation and one file write, not a second pass over the transcript.
#
# task_fail_count is the one field above that ISN'T free: it is a second, small jq pass over the
# same already-slurped transcript (see task_fail_count= above, next to task_count), because the
# breadth/naming mandates never needed to know whether a dispatch failed, only whether one
# happened. Without it this ledger recorded that N subagents were dispatched and nothing about
# what came back -- a session logging task_count:5 reads identically whether all five returned
# verified fixes or all five errored in the first second, and no claim about the routing layer
# can be supported by a number that cannot tell those apart.
#
# Log unconditionally, block conditionally: this runs whether or not $unmet ends up non-empty,
# so the log measures the behaviour (did breadth cross the threshold, did a dispatch happen) on
# every evaluated Stop, not just the ones a mandate happened to block. A log that only captured
# blocks would show a denominator only when the gate already fired, which is the gate's own
# effect, not the rate the gate is trying to move.
#
# Not logged: any Stop that exits before reaching even the latch above (VSTACK_NO_MANDATE=1, no
# jq, no readable transcript, or stop_hook_active). A latched Stop (cnt>=2) IS logged -- see the
# latch block near the top of this file -- but with null counts and latched:true instead of the
# fields below, because computing dir_count/ext_count/task_count there would mean paying for the
# transcript parse this comment's "not a second pass" claim is about, on a Stop that can no longer
# be blocked by anything that parse would find.
#
# Never lets logging break the hook's JSON-stdout-or-nothing contract: the entire block is one
# subshell with stderr discarded, nothing in it writes to this script's own stdout, and no
# command's exit status here is checked or allowed to change the exit path below.
#
# No file contents, no paths: session id, seven integer/boolean fields, and a timestamp --
# matching the same discipline the mandates above already apply to $paths before it ever reaches
# a message. task_fail_count carries a count, same as task_count, never which agent or what it
# was asked -- that stays out of this log for the same reason prompts stay out of the replay log
# (dispatch-counter.sh's own header makes the same call for the same reason).
#
# fanout_batches: already computed above at $fanout_batches, next to task_count -- passed straight

# Prove it works: a completion claim closing this turn with zero evidence produced in it.
#
# Every mandate above asks "did a skill run against a file this session touched", which the
# matcher above can answer because both halves -- the file, the skill invocation -- are things
# that already happened. This one is different in kind. principle-prove-it-works's trigger is
# "before declaring any task or fix done": a condition on the assistant's own next speech act,
# not on anything in the user's prompt. Skill dispatch scores the user's text against skill
# descriptions, so no description can reach a condition that names the assistant's own
# forthcoming output -- measured at 0/10 on its fixture prompt, the worst score of any principle
# skill, and not for lack of vocabulary overlap (its description contains both of the prompt's
# literal tokens). The thing that needs catching is not in the text being matched.
#
# This hook already runs on Stop, which is exactly the moment the condition is about: the turn
# is over, and whatever the assistant said last is what it is about to leave standing. So instead
# of asking a skill matcher to catch a property of unwritten text, this reads the transcript for
# it directly, the same way the mandates above read it for file writes.
#
# "This turn" is bounded by the transcript itself, not guessed: a real human turn starts at a
# "type":"user" entry whose content is a plain string, or an array with a "text" block and no
# "tool_result" block (a tool result is also logged as type "user" -- that is Claude Code's
# transcript format, not a human reply, and must not reset the boundary). Everything after the
# LAST such entry is this turn. A transcript with no such entry at all (every fixture in this
# repo's own test suites, which build a transcript as one bare assistant block with no user
# line) falls back to treating the whole file as the turn, which is what the two-line file this
# hook actually sees in a real session with a fresh session_id effectively already reduces to.
#
# Within that turn: did the closing remark claim completion, and did the turn edit a file while
# producing zero evidence? Both conditions gate the trigger, not either alone.
#
#   claim   -- the LAST assistant "text" block in the turn (i.e. the words actually left standing
#              when the turn ends, not something said and then acted past) matches a bounded list
#              of completion phrasings below.
#   edit    -- at least one Write/Edit/NotebookEdit tool_use happened in the turn. Without this,
#              a completion claim is conversational, not a claim about code, and the false-block
#              cost of guessing otherwise is worse than the miss (see the false-positive note by
#              the pattern list below).
#   silent  -- ANY Bash, Read, or Task/Agent tool_use anywhere in the turn, in any order relative to
#              the edit. This is deliberately generous in both directions: a Bash call is treated
#              as evidence whether or not it happens to be a test invocation, and a Read is
#              treated as evidence even if it came before the edit (i.e. was investigation of the
#              bug, not verification of the fix) rather than after it. Both loosen the trigger
#              past what "prove it works" strictly asks for. That is the intended trade: this
#              fires on every Stop of every install, so the cost of a rule this hook cannot
#              satisfy is not "the model tries again", it is "the mandate gets disabled" -- and
#              a disabled mandate catches nothing, including the 9 times it would have been
#              right. Ordering the Bash/Read calls against the edit to tighten this further was
#              considered and dropped: the added jq is not free, and the case it would catch (an
#              investigative Read with no verification after) is already the rarer shape.
#
# Known false-positive shape, disclosed rather than chased: a turn that Writes a genuinely
# unverifiable artifact -- a poem, a note, a scratch file with no "works" to check -- and closes
# with a plain "Done." trips this exactly like an unverified code fix would, because file-write
# plus closing "done" plus no Bash/Read/Task/Agent in the same turn is indistinguishable from here.
# Scoping the edit check to code-like extensions was considered and rejected: it would have
# meant maintaining an extension allowlist this hook has no way to keep current, trading one
# false-positive shape for a false-negative one (a `.sh` fix that never runs is exactly the case
# this exists to catch). Left as a known, bounded miss in the direction this file always prefers.
# A two-pass version of this was tried first: stream the file once in jq's default per-line
# mode to find which line the turn starts on (matching how every other mandate above reads the
# transcript), then hand only the tail after that line to a second, small jq call, on the theory
# that avoiding a whole-file `-s` slurp would be the cheaper path. Measured on a 37MB real
# session transcript it was slower, not faster -- +520ms over the streaming mandates alone in
# this hook, roughly triple this one-pass version's cost. The reason: shelling out to `tail -n
# +N` to extract that tail is not free on this platform. BSD `tail`'s from-line mode measured at
# ~400ms on this repo's own darwin box to extract an 11-line, 33KB tail from that same 1782-line
# file -- line-oriented access apparently is not the fast path GNU tail's implementation makes
# it look like elsewhere. jq's own `-s` slurp-then-slice of the same whole file measured ~170ms,
# faster than just the `tail` step of the "optimization" meant to beat it. Reverted to the
# simpler single-pass slurp below in favor of the version that is both less code and faster.
#
# Gated on eval_proveitworks specifically, not the family-level skill_eval: this jq slurp is
# prove-it-works's own cost alone (unslop/typescript-best-practices need none of turn_json), so
# now that the three no longer share a latch, this must not run just because unslop or
# typescript-best-practices still has headroom -- only because prove-it-works itself does.
